`🚧 New Features Under Development 🚧`

## What is mew 

`mew` is a command line tool, that will help you take backup of different config files (dotfiles) and store it in the ~/dotfiles folder. Then you can push the folder to github (or any remote repo manager) for safe keeping the files. `mew` will help you avoid the manual copy paste of the config files.
